# Folio

**Claude in your folder.**

## What is this?

A workspace where you and Claude collaborate on files together. Built for knowledge workers—if you work with documents, notes, PDFs, and research, this is for you.

## Getting Started

Download the latest release for macOS/Windows/Linux (coming soon).

Open Folio, point it at a folder, start chatting with Claude.

## How it works

- **Claude Code extension** provides the AI integration
- **Chat with Claude** in the sidebar
- **Claude can read and edit** files in your folder
- **Files are how you collaborate**—everything stays visible and in your control

## Why Folio?

The folder is your shared workspace. Files are edge objects that let you and Claude work together—synchronously in chat, or asynchronously through the file system.

No hidden state. No proprietary formats. Just you, Claude, and your files.
