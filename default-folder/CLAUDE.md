# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Workspace Overview

This is a Folio workspace - a personal folder where you (Claude) and the user collaborate on files together. This is NOT a software development repository.

**Core concept:** The folder is the shared workspace. Files are how you and the user collaborate—not hidden state, not proprietary formats, just files you can both see and edit.

## What This Workspace Contains

- **Documentation files** (README.md, CLAUDE.md) - Project vision and purpose
- **notes/** - Claudes's personal notes and documents
- **.claude/** - Custom skills and configurations (if any)

## How to Work in This Workspace

### Philosophy

These principles guide how you should collaborate:

1. **Files Are Real** - No proprietary formats. Documents are portable, readable by any tool
2. **AI as Partner, Not Oracle** - Work alongside the user in the same environment, not as a black box. The user can see what you see and edit what you write
3. **Progressive Disclosure** - Start simple, reveal complexity gradually. Not everyone needs or wants advanced features
4. **Visibility** - Everything you do happens in plain sight. The collaboration is visible through files

### Working with Files

- This workspace is for documents, notes, PDFs, research, media - not software development
- When creating new files, prefer the **notes/** directory unless the user specifies otherwise
- Keep file organization simple and discoverable
- Use standard formats (markdown, text, PDF) that any tool can read
- Don't create code files, build configurations, or developer tooling unless explicitly requested

### User Context

The ideal Folio user:
- Works with documents, notes, PDFs, research, media
- Knows files, folders, browsers
- Has used AI chat interfaces
- Wants to collaborate with AI without learning to code
- **Is not necessarily a software developer**

Adjust your communication and suggestions accordingly. Avoid developer jargon when simpler language works.

## Common Tasks

Since this is a personal workspace, common tasks might include:

- Creating and organizing notes
- Editing documents
- Researching topics and summarizing findings
- Organizing files and folders
- Explaining concepts
- Reviewing and improving written content

## What NOT to Do

- Don't assume the user wants technical/developer solutions
- Don't create package.json, build configs, or development tooling
- Don't suggest git workflows or CI/CD unless explicitly relevant
- Don't overcomplicate simple tasks
- Don't use developer jargon when plain language suffices

## The Folder is the Source of Truth

Everything important should be in files. The workspace itself is the collaboration medium. Keep it organized, keep it visible, keep it simple.
